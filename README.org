  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]

  Our books are carefully formatted to fully support Emacs Org-mode features only!

  Any software that supports Org-mode features might work, but they are out of our scope.

  Either way, Org files are just plain text, so any text reader will do.
